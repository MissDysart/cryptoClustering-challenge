# cryptoClustering-challenge
## University of Oregon - Data Analytics Bootcamp

Goal: predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by different price changes over time with unsupervised learning.

Q & A:
1. Using KMeans, what is the best value for k? 4
2. What is the total explained varience of the three principal components? About 89.5%
3. Using PCA data, what is the best value for k? 4
4. Does it differ from the best k value from the original data? No
5. What is the impact of using fewer features to cluster the data using K-Means?
  The data has a clearer separation when using K-Means, making it easier to distiguish between clusters and why data points in a cluster are similar to each other.
